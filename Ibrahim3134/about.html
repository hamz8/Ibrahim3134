    <p> I'm a stay at home mom of 5 and know the true definition of a "me day". Sometimes, you have to
      have a nice simple spa day to yourself to simply feel like you have it all together. I am also
      a firm beleiver in self care of your sanity and skin. Thus my passion for bathbombs came about.
      Bathbombs are like a portable relaxtion time and cost friendly compared to huge companies who
      charges an arm and a leg for a simple bodily care routine.
      All my products are chemical and animal testing free and organic. Let my bath therapy be the
      reason why you feel less stressed for the day. We cater everything from bridal favors,
      baby showers, anniversaries and much more!</p>
